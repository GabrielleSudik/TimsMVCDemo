This is the MVC .NET Core App.
Note when you start it up it's just like the 
boilerplate Razor Pages app.
Some of the URLs are named slightly different is all.

-- Add the DLL (the Common DB Project) --

Same steps as before: First, copy paste the .dll file
from the DataLibrary project - bin/Release folder.
Next, add it as a dependency.

WAIT.

Apparently I referenced it wrong in RzrPagesApp.
I referenced the one in the Common / DL project,
when I should have referenced the .dll that was
copied to the RzrPagesApp project!
"Wrong" is too strong -- Tim says it's not bad that way
but referencing in the in-project one is better.

Then add the DataLibrary.dll's package dependencies
to this project's dependencies (found in .csproj file).
Go to the DL's .csproj file (in a text editor is fine)
and copy paste what you need.

An alternative: Manually add them from this project
using Nuget Package Manager. But copy pasting is easier.

-- Dependency Injection --

Check notes in Startup.cs.
Your notes are more robust in the Razor Pages project.
But it's basically the same.

-- Add the ConnectionString --

appsettings.json -- ConnectionsStrings info.
Get the string from your TimsDinerDB properties,
using SQL Server Object Explorer.
Recall you have "Default" mentioned in various places
to connect everything.

Tim reminds us we probably don't want to commit
the connectionString. Either by not committing appsettings file
or in this project: Manage User Secrets and do stuff.
(I'm fine with it for these little demos, but good point.)

-- Routing --

Startup.cs
Check out UseEndpoints() for some notes about routes.

-- Creating Data --

Right click Controllers folder - add new controller -
pick MVC / Empty (you could pick other MVC ones if you wanted).
Make sure you name the controller the exact same thing as your route:
Route = Orders, controller = OrdersController.

OrdersController.cs has your notes.

Also: Models - add - class - name it OrderCreateModel.
See notes there.

Right-click OrdersController.cs.Create() method name - 
Add View - name it Create, select its function (create), 
pick its model class: OrderCreateModel. Now you have a Views/Orders/Create.cshtml.
See notes there.

-- Reading Data --

OrdersController.cs - see notes. Display() method.
Also: Models - add - class - name it OrderDisplayModel.

Add another view, based on Display(). (see instructions in last step)
We kept it as an empty template, so no matching model class.

Display.cshtml

And another view: for Food. We need a new FoodController first. Make it.
Then use Index() method to create the view.
You again selected an empty template. 

NOTE the reason to select the template is to provide a list
of possible models for the page.
Selecting empty just means you manually type in in the view.
(Useful for when your templates don't match up with the model you want.)

-- Updating Data --

OrdersController - and we'll add stuff to the Display view:
Update() method, and in Display.cshtml, the <form asp-action="Update"> stuff.

-- Deleting Data --

OrdersController - new Delete() method.
Create the new Delete View with the right-click Delete() way.
And add a bit to Display.cshtml so people can delete the order they look at.

-- Publishing --

Like Razor Pages, Tim walks through the publishing steps.
You're not doing it because you can't complete (yet).
