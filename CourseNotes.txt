This is the MVC .NET Core App.
Note when you start it up it's just like the 
boilerplate Razor Pages app.
Some of the URLs are named slightly different is all.

-- Add the DLL (the Common DB Project) --

Same steps as before: First, copy paste the .dll file
from the DataLibrary project - bin/Release folder.
Next, add it as a dependency.

WAIT.

Apparently I referenced it wrong in RzrPagesApp.
I referenced the one in the Common / DL project,
when I should have referenced the .dll that was
copied to the RzrPagesApp project!
"Wrong" is too strong -- Tim says it's not bad that way
but referencing in the in-project one is better.

Then add the DataLibrary.dll's package dependencies
to this project's dependencies (found in .csproj file).
Go to the DL's .csproj file (in a text editor is fine)
and copy paste what you need.

An alternative: Manually add them from this project
using Nuget Package Manager. But copy pasting is easier.

-- Dependency Injection --

Check notes in Startup.cs.
Your notes are more robust in the Razor Pages project.
But it's basically the same.
